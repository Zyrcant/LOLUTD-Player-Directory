This player directory is meant to offer a way to connect the members of the LOLUTD club and allow them to easily find other people to play with. This app allows for players to see others' ranks and positions so they can easily find a partner to queue or create a team with. The ability to sort by rank or by role is implemented, which should help with finding players. This project has been given a Development API Key by Riot so the ranks of the players are pulled directly from Riot's API to ensure the ranks are up to date. (API Key and Database Credentials have been intentionally stripped from the code for security purposes)
